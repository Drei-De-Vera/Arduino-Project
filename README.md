## Sub-Projects

### 1. Agrospraytech
- **Description**: A collaborative project combining Arduino and Raspberry Pi. I was responsible for programming the Arduino side. The system is an automated robotic car capable of detecting eggplants and watering them. It can also be manually controlled via a Bluetooth controller.

### 2. Cheating Detection
- **Description**: A project developed using Arduino and ESP microcontrollers, where I handled the Arduino programming. It uses a microphone module to detect sounds within a specified range, aiding in monitoring for potential cheating activities.

### 3. Chicken Feeder
- **Description**: An automated chicken feeder that allows users to schedule feeding times up to three times a day. It utilizes an ultrasonic sensor to detect if the feed storage is empty. After the initial feeding, it automatically dispenses water. A Real-Time Clock (RTC) module is used to track date and time.

### 4. CocoFlex Palapa
- **Description**: A machine that shreds Palapa into fine particles, weighs the material, adds a binding agent, and then heats and presses it to form a flat sheet.

### 5. Mushroom Fruiting Bag
- **Description**: This machine mixes substrate materials, dispenses them into a rotating container, and then uses an actuator to compress the mixture into mushroom fruiting bags.

### 6. Pandaiku
- **Description**: A machine designed like an oven that heats pandan leaves and flattens them using a stainless steel rolling mechanism.

### 7. PNC Fire Fighting
- **Description**: A collaborative project where I was responsible for programming the Arduino. Itâ€™s a fire-detecting robot that uses a LiDAR sensor to detect and avoid obstacles, and it can extinguish detected fires autonomously.

### 8. Seed Dryer
- **Description**: A cylindrical machine designed to dry seeds using a controlled heating process. Once the drying is complete, it automatically dispenses the dried seeds.

### 9. Trainer
- **Description**: A training board that includes various sensors and modules designed for beginners. It serves as a hands-on practice platform for learning Arduino-based sensor integration and programming.

### 10. Dragon Fruit
- **Description**: A collaborative project where I handled the Arduino programming. The machine sorts dragon fruits by size (small, medium, large) and identifies defective fruits.

### 11. Multi Crop
- **Description**: A smart storage unit similar to a refrigerator that maintains optimal temperature conditions based on the type of fruit stored, such as pineapple or dragon fruit. It uses NIR Triad Spectroscopy to identify the fruit and adjust the environment accordingly.

### 12. Paper Briquette
- **Description**: A machine that processes shredded paper into cylindrical briquettes. It includes weighing, grinding, water and binder dispensing, mixing, and molding functions to form the briquettes.

### 13. Sapling
- **Description**:  A machine that creates biodegradable flower pots using shredded plastic bottles, coffee grounds, starch, agar-agar, water, vinegar, and glycerin. It weighs and mixes the ingredients, heats them for a set duration, then molds the mixture into plant pots.
